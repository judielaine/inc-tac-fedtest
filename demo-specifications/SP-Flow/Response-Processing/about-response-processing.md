# About SP Response Processing Flow

The SP Response Processing Flow section measures an SP's ability to process SAML responses from an IdP. There are many possible scenarios. Some may include:

* Processing basic, single factor authentication response
* Processing REFEDS MFA authentication response
* Processing errors requiring IdP handling (missing required user attribute, etc) -> ability to invoke IdP Error URL
* Processing other unexpected responses, including HTTP errors
